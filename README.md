## Web Performance Dashboard: Tracking Engagement and Conversion Metrics

In my BI project focused on website performance, I began by importing datasets from MySQL. After ensuring data cleanliness, I enhanced analysis potential by adding crucial DAX measures and calculated columns. I established logical relationships between tables like order items, refunds, orders, products, website pageviews, and website sessions. The resulting dashboard boasts user-friendly features like slicers for year and months, and it contains informative KPI cards indicating total sessions, total orders, and overall conversion rate.

Visual insights are provided through a pie chart showcasing total sessions categorized by utm_campaigns and utm_source. Additionally, another pie chart represents total conversion rates categorized by the same parameters. The dashboard also features a funnel chart depicting user interactions through pageview URLs. A dynamic line chart traces the trajectory of total sessions and total orders over time.

This Website Performance Dashboard empowers effective monitoring and decision-making, offering clear insights into user engagement, traffic sources, conversion rates, and pageview interactions, all while being intuitive and accessible.

### Objective
>What is the sequence of user interactions, as represented by the funnel chart, from the initial pageview URL to the final website pageview ID?

>How do the trends in total sessions and total orders vary over the years and months, as shown in the line chart?

> Which campaign and source combination exhibits the highest conversion rate in the matrix table, and what is the corresponding percentage?

>Which utm_campaigns and utm_source combination generated the highest total sessions and which utm_campaigns and utm_source combination generated the highest conversion rate?
